// Rule is a policy rule which must be applied to all endpoints which match the
// labels contained in the endpointSelector
//
// Each rule is split into an ingress section which contains all rules
// applicable at ingress, and an egress section applicable at egress. For rule
// types such as `L4Rule` and `CIDR` which can be applied at both ingress and
// egress, both ingress and egress side have to either specifically allow the
// connection or one side has to be omitted.
//
// Either ingress, egress, or both can be provided. If both ingress and egress
// are omitted, the rule has no effect.
